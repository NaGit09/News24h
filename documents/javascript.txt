JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used in web development.
Unlike HTML and CSS, which focus on structure and style, JavaScript adds logic,
interactivity, and behavior to web pages.

JavaScript runs in the browser and allows you to:
    Handle user events (like clicks or form inputs)
    Modify HTML and CSS on the fly
    Send and receive data from servers (using APIs)
    Build rich web applications like calculators, games, or dashboards.

Today, JavaScript is not just a browser-based language. 
With environments like Node.js, it can also be used to write server-side applications,
command-line tools, and more.


Execution context : 
    Global execution context 
    Function execution context
    Evaluation context

Hoisting : 
    var hoisted value = undefined
    const,let hoisted value = ReferenceError
    function hoisted value = function

Scope : 
    Global scope
    Function scope
    Block scope

Scope chain : 
    Local -> Outer -> Global
    
JS use Lexical scope , determine scope at declaration time

Closure: A function that remembers the scope where it was created,
 even after it has left that scope.

    
Promise -> Async/Await :

Async : Keyword to declare a function as asynchronous , alway return promise object
Await : Keyword to pause the execution of an async function until a Promise is resolved

Memory management and garbage collection : 

    Mark & Sweep : 
        1. Mark : Mark all objects in use
        2. Sweep : Remove all objects that are not marked
    
    Memory leak : 
        1. Global variables
        2. Event listeners
        3. setInterval and setTimeout
        4. Closures

ES6 : 
    1) Destructuring 
        - Array destructuring : [...array]
        - Object destructuring : {...object}
        - Nested destructuring : {...object}
        - Default values : [...array = []]
        - Rest parameters : (...args)

    2) Spread / Rest
        - Array spread : [...array]
        - Object spread : {...object}
        - Rest parameters : (...args)

    3) Arrow function
        - () => {}
        - (param) => {}
        - (param1, param2) => {}
        - (param1, param2) => {return param1 + param2}
    
    4) Modules
        - Import : import {name} from 'module'
        - Export : export {name}
    
    5) Optional chaning
        - obj?.prop 
    
    6) Nullish coalescing
        - ??
